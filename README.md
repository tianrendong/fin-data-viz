# fin-data-viz

This repo consists of three main python scripts:

1. `save_prices.py`: saves the SPX price data from Yahoo Finance to CSV.
2. `compute_changes.py`: computes the peer to peer price change of SPX across years; it also saves the results to CSV.
3. `generate_plots.py`: generates plots to visualize the price changes of SPX.

There is a basic HTML webpage that shows all the plots.
